## 🎯 **About the Project**  
Interviews are stressful, unpredictable, and often leave candidates **unsure about their performance**. We wanted to **change that**. Flux was born from the idea that **anyone can master interviews with the right coaching**—so why not use **AI to simulate real-world interview scenarios** and provide **instant, expert feedback?**  

Our mission: **Empower job seekers to walk into any interview with confidence.**  

## 💡 **What Inspired Us**  
As students and job seekers ourselves, we know the struggle of **not knowing if your answers are good enough** or how to improve. We wanted a **smart, interactive, and accessible** way to **practice and refine** interview skills—without needing a human coach. AI was the perfect solution.  

## 🛠️ **How We Built It**  
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, CSS for a sleek, user-friendly interface.  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, and Supabase for data management.  
- **AI Model:** OpenAI’s **Whisper** for speech-to-text transcription and **GPT-4o-mini** for intelligent feedback and personalized interview advising.  
- **Deployment:** Hosted on **Render** for frontend and backend.

## 🚧 **Challenges We Faced**  
🔹 **Speech-to-Text Accuracy:** Implementing OpenAI Whisper required optimizing **audio processing** for different accents and speech patterns.  
🔹 **Realistic AI Feedback:** Ensuring **constructive, concise, and relevant** feedback from GPT-4o-mini was an ongoing challenge.  
🔹 **Frontend-to-Backend Communication:** Managing **real-time updates** and **seamless API integration** required debugging unexpected **CORS issues**.  
🔹 **Email Feedback System:** Implementing **Nodemailer with secure authentication** to send AI-generated feedback to users was tricky.  

## 🎉 **What We Learned**  
✅ **Optimizing AI prompts** for **realistic, actionable** interview feedback.  
✅ **Handling file uploads & transcriptions** in a smooth, scalable way.  
✅ **Improving UI/UX** to create an intuitive, engaging **mock interview experience**.  
✅ **Security & Scalability** when handling **user-generated data** (interview answers, feedback storage, and email delivery).
